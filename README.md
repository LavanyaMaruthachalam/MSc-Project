Thirukkural Response System
Overview
The Thirukkural Response System is an advanced AI-based project designed to interpret and provide responses based on the classical Tamil literature, Thirukkural. It integrates traditional rule-based methods with state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to deliver meaningful and contextually accurate explanations and translations of the Thirukkural verses.
Objectives
•	Preservation and Dissemination: To preserve the wisdom of Thirukkural and make it accessible to a broader audience through modern technological means.
•	Advanced Interpretation: To utilize AI for interpreting the verses, providing both traditional explanations and modern contextual understandings.
•	Language Translation: To translate the verses and their meanings between Tamil and English accurately.
Key Components
Data Loading and Preprocessing
The project starts by loading Thirukkural data from a JSON file. The data consists of verses, their meanings, and explanations by notable commentators like Mu. Varadarasanar and Salamon Pappaiya.
Query Handling
Queries are handled based on their type, which can be a kural number, keyword, chapter name, or section name. The system retrieves the relevant verses and provides explanations based on the query.
Translation
Using the googletrans library, the system translates the verses and their explanations between Tamil and English, ensuring accessibility for non-Tamil speakers.
Model Training with GPT-2
The project involves training a GPT-2 model on the Thirukkural data. This involves formatting the data, tokenizing it, and creating a custom dataset for training.

Steps:

Formatting the Data
Tokenizing the Data
Creating a Custom Dataset
Training the Model

Advanced Response Handling with GPT-4
For complex queries that do not fit predefined rule-based criteria, the system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model. This involves setting up the model to handle chat-based interactions and generate responses.

Dispatcher Function
The dispatcher function decides whether to use rule-based responses or AI-based responses, ensuring that the system can handle a wide range of queries effectively.

Benefits and Applications
Educational Tool: This system can be used as an educational tool to teach students and enthusiasts about the Thirukkural and its timeless wisdom.
Research: Scholars can use the system to explore the meanings and interpretations of various verses in different contexts.
Cultural Preservation: By translating and explaining Thirukkural verses, the system helps preserve Tamil culture and literature.
Interactive Learning: The AI-based responses provide an interactive way to learn about the Thirukkural, making it more engaging for users.


Conclusion
The Thirukkural Response System is a blend of traditional literary wisdom and modern AI technology, aiming to make the profound teachings of Thirukkural accessible and understandable to a global audience. Through advanced natural language processing and translation capabilities, it not only preserves the essence of the Thirukkural but also adapts it to contemporary contexts, providing valuable insights for today's world.
